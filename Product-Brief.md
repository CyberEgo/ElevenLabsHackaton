# Lexia - Product Brief

## The Problem

**10-15% of people have dyslexia** - that's over 50 million adults in English-speaking countries alone. For them, everyday tasks like reading emails, writing reports, or reviewing documents take 2-3 times longer than their peers and often feel exhausting.

Here's what makes it so hard:

- **Reading is slow and draining.** People with dyslexia process text 2-3x slower than average. A 10-page report that takes most people 20 minutes might take an hour or more, leaving them mentally exhausted.

- **Unfamiliar words stop them in their tracks.** When they encounter words they haven't seen before, they can't easily "sound them out" - their brain just can't decode the pronunciation from the letters.

- **Writing creates constant anxiety.** They worry about spelling errors, misusing similar-sounding words (like "their" vs "there"), and whether their writing sounds professional.

- **Current tools don't work together.** To get through a document, they might use Speechify to listen, switch to Dragon to dictate edits, then copy-paste into ChatGPT for corrections. Every tool switch breaks their flow and adds mental overhead.

**The real problem isn't any single task - it's that reading, writing, and editing live in separate apps.** When you have to constantly switch contexts, you lose your train of thought and waste energy just managing tools instead of doing your actual work.

## Who This Is For

**Primary users:** Adults with dyslexia who work with text regularly - knowledge workers, students, writers, professionals. They've developed coping strategies over the years, but they're tired of working twice as hard for the same results.

**Secondary users:** Content creators who want to work faster, non-native English speakers who benefit from hearing text read aloud, and anyone who finds voice input more natural than typing.

These are people who:
- Spend hours reviewing documents that should take minutes
- Re-read emails multiple times before hitting send, worried about errors
- Avoid video calls where they might have to pronounce unfamiliar terms
- Feel exhausted after a day of reading and writing

They're looking for a tool that works **with** their brain, not against it.

## Our Solution

**Lexia is a Chrome extension that lets you read, write, and edit any text on the web - entirely by voice.**

Instead of juggling multiple apps, everything happens right where you're already working: Gmail, Google Docs, Notion, Slack, anywhere on the web.

### How It Works

**When you need to read:**
- Select any text on a webpage
- Click play - it reads aloud with each word highlighted as it's spoken
- Adjust the speed (0.75x to 2x) based on how fast you process information
- When it finishes, click "Repeat" to hear it again at a slower pace for better comprehension
- Highlight any word or concept and get a spoken explanation in plain language


**When you need to write:**
- Click in any text field
- Hold the V key and speak - your words appear as you talk
- If you mispronounce something (like saying "their" when you meant "there"), the AI catches it and asks "Did you mean...?" before inserting the text
- Release the key - your text is inserted exactly where you need it

**When you need to edit:** (Future Feature)
- Highlight text you've written and click "Edit Mode"
- A chat window opens where you can talk to your text
- Say things like "make this sound more professional" or "explain what prognosis means"
- Listen to the changes, make more adjustments by voice, then apply them back to your document
- No typing, no copy-pasting between apps

**When you need confidence:**
- Before sending an email or submitting work, highlight what you wrote
- Click play to hear it read back to you
- Your ear catches awkward phrasing or mistakes that your eyes missed
- Make quick fixes by voice, then send with confidence

## What Makes Lexia Different

**We're the tool that combines reading, writing, and editing in one voice-first workflow.**

Other tools force you to choose:
- **Speechify** reads text beautifully, but you can't edit what you hear
- **Wispr Flow** lets you dictate anywhere, but can't read text back to you
- **ChatGPT** can prompt with voice, but lives in a separate tab - you have to copy-paste back and forth
- **Grammarly** fixes grammar, but only works with typed text

**Lexia does all of it, in the tab you're working.**

## How You Use It

**Free to use** - Lexia is a free Chrome extension. You just need your own API keys from:
- ElevenLabs (for text-to-speech) - free tier includes 10,000 characters/month
- Anthropic Claude (for AI editing) - pay-as-you-go pricing

This "bring your own key" model means you control your data, your usage, and your costs. We don't store any of your text or charge subscription fees.

**Works everywhere** - Gmail, Google Docs, Notion, Slack, LinkedIn, Medium, or any website where you read and write. No copying and pasting between apps.

**Privacy-first** - Your text goes directly from your browser to ElevenLabs and Claude using your API keys. We don't see it, we don't store it, we don't track it.

## Our Positioning

**"Work the way your brain thinks - by speaking, not typing."**

Lexia is for people who think clearly but struggle with the mechanics of reading and writing. We're not trying to "fix" dyslexia - we're building tools that match how dyslexic brains naturally process information: through listening and speaking.

For dyslexic professionals who've spent their lives working twice as hard to keep up, Lexia means finally working at the speed of your thoughts instead of the speed of your typing.
